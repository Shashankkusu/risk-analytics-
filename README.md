## üöÄ Overview
This project focuses on risk analytics, particularly credit risk classification, using machine learning models such as Random Forest and Decision Tree. The dataset used is **German Credit Data**, and the goal is to predict the likelihood of a customer defaulting on a loan.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Credit Risk Classification**: Predict loan default risk.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementation of Random Forest and Decision Tree classifiers.
- **Performance Evaluation**: High accuracy (99.33%) using precision, recall, and f1-score metrics.
- **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and scaling.

## üì¶ Installation
Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed, then follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/risk-analytics.git
   cd risk-analytics
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Download the dataset (`german_credit_data.xls`) and place it in the project directory.

## üöÄ Running the Model
To train and evaluate the model, run:
```bash
python risk_analysis.py
```
This will preprocess the data, train the models, and generate classification reports.
